[Yandex Scraper](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/serp/yandex) allows you to collect localized data from Yandex search results pages (SERPs) in real time without any blocks on a large scale.

Follow this guide to scrape Yandex search results using our [Scraper API](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api). 

### How it works

You can receive Yandex search results by providing URLs to our service or using [scraping parameters](https://developers.oxylabs.io/scraper-apis/serp-scraper-api/yandex) to let us form them on our end. The API returns an HTML or structured JSON of any Yandex page.

#### Python code example

The example below shows how to get a result from a Yandex SERP in HTML format.

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint

# Structure payload.
payload = {
   'source': 'yandex',
   'url': 'https://yandex.com/search/?text=nike&'
}

# Get response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('YOUR_USERNAME', 'YOUR_PASSWORD'), #Your credentials go here
    json=payload,
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with results.
pprint(response.json())
```

```json
